    parsing it. The parts that are specialized are marked by

        Data is a string with the serialized RDF graph (eg RDF/XML, N3
        ... ). By default RF/XML is expected. The optional parameter _format
        can be used to tell rdflib otherwise.

        It raises a ``RDFParserException`` if there was some error during
        the parsing.
